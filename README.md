# Space Shape Analyser

## Overview

The Space Shape Analyzer Program is a C++ application that analyzes 2D geometric shapes. Ideal for environments requiring precise measurements, such as aboard the futuristic starship Enterprise-2D, this program excels in reading sensor data, calculating areas, generating comprehensive reports, and organizing shape data based on various criteria.

## Key Features

- **Input Sensor Data**: Manually input sensor data for various 2D shapes.
- **Compute Area**: Calculates the 'mass' (area) of the shapes based on input data.
- **Shapes Report**: Generates detailed reports highlighting points on the perimeter and inside the shape.
- **Sort Shape Data**: Sorts shape data by type, area (in ascending or descending order), and other specific criteria.

## Project Setup

To set up the Space Shape Analyzer Program, you'll need a C++ compiler. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/space-shape-analyzer.git
   ```

2. **Compile the Program**:
   Navigate to the project directory and compile the program using your C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o SpaceShapeAnalyzer SpaceShapeAnalyzer.cpp -std=c++11
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./SpaceShapeAnalyzer
   ```
   Follow the on-screen instructions to input data and utilize the program's functionalities.
