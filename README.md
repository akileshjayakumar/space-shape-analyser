# Space Shape Analyser Program

## Overview

The Space Shape Analyzer Program is a C++ application designed to analyze 2D geometric shapes. It is capable of reading sensor data for various shapes, computing their area, generating reports, and sorting the shape data based on different criteria. This program is inspired by a futuristic scenario where such computations are needed aboard the starship Enterprise-2D.

## Features

- **Input Sensor Data**: Allows manual input of sensor data related to different 2D shapes.
- **Compute Area**: Calculates the area (referred to as 'mass' within the context) of the input shapes.
- **Shapes Report**: Generates a detailed report listing points on the perimeter or within the shape's area.
- **Sort Shape Data**: Enables sorting of shape data by type, area (ascending/descending), and special criteria.

## Installation

To run the Space Shape Analyzer Program, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/space-shape-analyzer.git

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory and compile the program using your C++ compiler. For example, if you are using `g++`, you can compile the program like this:

g++ -o Assn2 Assn2.cpp -std=c++11

After compiling, you can run the program by executing:

./Assn2

Follow the on-screen prompts to input sensor data, compute areas, generate reports, and sort data as needed.
